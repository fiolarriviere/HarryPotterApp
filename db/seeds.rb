  name: "Harry Potter", review: "The boy wizard grows up smart, reserved and quietly, fiercely loyal to his friends and ideals. Despite carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and a sense of incipient doom in his heart, he stays determined throughout the series. For that steadfastness and courage, he'll always be our hero.", actor: "Daniel Radcliffe", image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/abdulaba/image/upload/v1669900365/Harry/Harry-Potter__htwqje.jpg"

  name: "Hermione Granger", review: "Hermione may start the Harry Potter films as an insufferable know-it-all, but she finishes them as an entirely sufferable, even loveable, know-it-all, someone who doesn't hide her smarts but also gives the people around her credit for intelligence as well. They wouldn't get far without her problem-solving and research abilities, not to mention her quick responses to danger.", actor: "Emma Watson", image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/abdulaba/image/upload/v1669900364/Harry/Hermione-Granger__ze0mnx.jpg"

But we love Ron because he always comes right in the end, abandoning resentment for affection and standing by both his blood family and surrogate family.", actor: "Rupert Grint", image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/abdulaba/image/upload/v1669900365/Harry/Ron-Weasley__lyqtwc.jpg"

He was a very good student and a Prefect. Harry and Cedric decided to take hold of the Triwizard Cup together and share the win. However, he was killed by Wormtail on Lord Voldemort's command when the Cup turned out to be a Portkey.", actor: "Robert Pattinson", image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/abdulaba/image/upload/v1669900365/Harry/Cedric-Diggory__teeyto.jpg"

  name: "Rubeus Hagrid", review: "He's big, he's tough, and he has the soft heart of a 10 year-old girl. Only instead of being soppy about ponies or puppies or the colour pink, Hagrid's a rollover for dragons, giant spiders, three-headed monster dogs and giant meat-eating death-horses. He is perhaps the warmest, making no effort to hide how much he cares for his friends (and pets) and with that big sentimental streak always just under the surface.", actor: "Robbie Coltrane", image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/abdulaba/image/upload/v1669900364/Harry/Rubeus-Hagrid__izy7qd.jpg"

As wise as he is bearded, as eccentric as he is powerful and as fond of sherbet lemons as any man who ever lived, Dumbledore is a father figure and mentor to Harry but one who isn't slow about sending him into mortal peril when the occasion calls for it.", actor: "Richard Harris, Michael Gambon", image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/abdulaba/image/upload/v1669900364/Harry/Albus-Dumbledore__ztskyf.jpg"
